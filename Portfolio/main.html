    <div class="bio">
        <p>
            I am 23 years old and currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah.<br>
            Honestly for as long as I have lived there has been too many hobbies but the ones
            I've enjoyed the most are:
        </p>
        <ul class="bio-list">
            <li>Music Production (Ableton, Logic, Pro Tools)</li>
            <li>Music Listening (Currently listening to Jordan Rakei and Kiefer)</li>
            <li>Hiking/Backpacking</li>
            <li>Electrical, Engineering Design</li>
            <li>World Studies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Before Coding Temple I was trained as a Sound Engineer for concerts and other productions
            like musical theatre since middle school. <br>This took me to Florida for certified training
            that helped me end up at Clair Global in Pennsylvania. I was touring for 3 years total
            traveling<br> with the likes of Florance and the Machine, Meek Mill feat. Future, Kanye West,
            Travis Scott, and more..<br><br>
            When Covid started in 2020 touring came to a halt leaving me without work for more than a year
            and a half. This left me with the<br>
            choice to either continue my career touring or look for something more steady. Here is where coding
            came into play. I had always<br> had interest in computers since I was a child and the incredible versatility
            that comes with it. With plently of Youtube as a resource <br>I had learned more and more about what's
            possible and it has wanted me to take advantage of that so I can start creating. <br>
            Coding Temple showed up on a data science website that gave me the flag in my mind that I should
            move onto another career. <br>
            Getting through this class will give me a huge head start in my achieving my goals.
